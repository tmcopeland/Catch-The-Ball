Catch The Ball by Dylan Taylor
------------------------------

An attempt at making a basic game for the Android platform.
The idea is to have a basic circle bouncing around the screen, and have a
timer (based on the difficulty) that the user must tap the ball within.
As the user progresses through levels, the ball will bounce faster.
If the user taps and misses, one seconds will be subtracted from the time left.

Difficulties and Timer Length:
  Easy        12 Seconds
  Medium      9 Seconds
  Hard        6 Seconds
  Insane      3 Seconds
