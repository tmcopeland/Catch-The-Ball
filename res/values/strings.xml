    <string name="about_text">I started this project in order to learn how to create Android applications.
        The object of the game is to tap on the ball bouncing around the screen before the timer runs out.
        As you progress through levels, your reflexes will be challenged by the gradually increasing speed of the ball.
        The higher the difficulty, the less time you have.
        If you miss the ball, you lose a second.
        Run out of time, and you lose.
        Although easy mode gives you plenty of time with 12 seconds, insane mode only gives you 3.\n\n
        <i>Are you up to the challenge?</i>
